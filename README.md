# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built the html and css of a website that is visually appealing. When a user clicks the receive message button they can either receive a randomly-generated mantra or affirmation. The app is solving the need for receiving affirmations and mantras.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Fork the github repository, run git clone in their terminal, and open the application in vs code.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am 3 weeks into mod1. I worked on it for approximately 15 hours. I was honestly pretty burnt out and did not put in as much work as I needed to in order to finish the project.

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
To recreate a functional website working with javascript, html, and CSS.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The struggled to find the motivation to grind long hours on the project with winter festivities and burn out, I also struggled with finding a way to space out the mantra and affirmation radios playing with the display flex on vs code and in dev tools.
